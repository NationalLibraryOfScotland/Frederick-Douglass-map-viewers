'Our Bondage and Our Freedom' - Frederick Douglass in Edinburgh and Scotland
============================================================================

These <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/douglass/index.html">map viewers</a> form part of the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/literatures-languages-cultures/research/current-projects/our-bondage-and-our-freedom" >Our Bondage and Our Freedom project</a>, celebrating the 200 year anniversary of the birth of African American activist and author, Frederick Douglass, in 2018. 

The <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/douglass/index.html">viewers</a> use <a href="http://openlayers.org">OpenLayers 4.4.2</a>, <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery</a> to provide animation and a scrollable left panel, and <a href="https://www.maptiler.com/desktop/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaics of historical maps. 

They include a <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/douglass/">map of the places in Edinburgh</a> where Frederick Douglass lived, held meetings and gave speeches during his antislavery campaign. 

There are also map viewers showing <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/douglass/abolitionists.html">Black Abolitionists in Edinburgh</a>, and the places associated with <a href="https://geo.nls.uk/maps/douglass/scotland.html">Frederick Douglass in Scotland</a>.

The locations associated with Douglass and the Black Abolitionists are shown using <a href="http://geojson.org/geojson-spec.html">GeoJSON</a> sets of points. The unique numbers of these points are used to link between the leftpanel texts and the points on the map, and from the points on the map to the leftpanel text.

The content for this map has principally been gathered by Dr Celeste Marie-Bernier, with assistance from Nick Batho and Andrew Taylor. The map viewers have been put together by Chris Fleet.
