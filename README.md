NLSExploreGeoreferencedMaps
===========================

This <a href="http://geo.nls.uk/maps/dev/sixinchexplore/index.html">demonstration application</a> uses <a href="http://dev.openlayers.org/releases/OpenLayers-2.13.1/">OpenLayers 2.13</a>, a <a href="http://jqueryui.com/">JQuery UI</a> transparency slider and <a href="http://www.maptiler.com/">MapTiler</a> georeferenced mosaics to form a viewer for the OS six-inch 1888-1913 maps of Great Britain as an historical georeferenced map mosaic. Searching is possible by zooming in on the map, with an option to change the map base layer between OpenStreetMap, Bing and Google layers. Searching is also possible by using a Google gazetteer (using the Google Maps API v3), a British National Grid Reference, as well as historic county and parish drop-down lists. 

The application accompanies the <a href="https://github.com/NationalLibraryOfScotland/NLSFindMapsByPlace">NLSFindMapsByPlace</a> Github repository and application, sharing a similar interface, use of OpenLayers, gazetteer search and css.

View a more <a href="http://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/">complete working version of the application</a> on the National Library of Scotland Map Images website.
